// The cache daemon.
//
// One long-lived process per cache directory owns that cache's storage layers
// and serves lookups and stores to compiles over a Unix socket. A compile still
// does everything that needs its own environment -- argument parsing, root
// mapping, preprocessing, hashing, running the compiler -- and hands the
// daemon only finished keys and blobs. What moves into the daemon is what a
// per-compile process can never amortise:
//
//   * S3 connections. Each upload worker and each lookup slot keeps one libcurl
//     handle, so the TCP connection and TLS session survive between requests
//     instead of being rebuilt on every compile. libcurl is also loaded once,
//     not once per compile.
//   * S3 uploads. A store writes the disk layer and returns; the upload runs on
//     a background worker. The compile no longer waits on a PUT.
//   * Authority over the cache. Every store and every backfill goes through one
//     process, which is the place a future distributed-compilation scheduler
//     would hang off.
//
// Uploads queued for an entry already on disk are journalled as empty marker
// files under <state>/pending/, so a daemon that is killed or crashes uploads
// them after it restarts rather than losing them.
